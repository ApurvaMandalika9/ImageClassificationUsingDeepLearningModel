# ImageClassificationUsingDeepLearningModel

This project implements a deep learning model for image classification using the CIFAR-10 dataset. It introduces a novel model inspired by Dense Convolutional Networks (DenseNet) and Residual Networks (ResNet), combining concepts from both architectures to achieve improved performance. The model architecture features dense connections similar to DenseNet, promoting feature reuse and gradient flow throughout the network.
Additionally, elements from ResNet, such as bottleneck structures and residual connections, are incorporated to further enhance learning efficiency and model expressiveness. While not strictly adhering to the Dual Path Network (DPN) architecture, this model leverages concepts from DenseNet and ResNet to achieve notable performance gains. DenseNet is known for its simple structure compared to its performance.
